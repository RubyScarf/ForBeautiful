        i actually started this before the Christmas one<br>
        although i didn't do anything for months<br>
        but i had to finish it 
      </p>
      <p class="text">Happy birthday, Beautiful!! You are legally allowed to drink alcohol now! YIPPEE!!! I canâ€™t express how grateful I am to have you in my life. 
        I feel incredibly lucky to be able to call you my friend. I pray that what awaits you is huge and divine, that you succeed 
        in everything you strive for, that you find joy and happiness in what you love, and that you never change who you are, because THE Rakuyama Yuri  
        is incredible and perfect. Whether you know it or not, it is true. You are astonishing :)
        It might sound silly given I met you just several months ago, but I'm genuinely, wholeheartedly, decisively proud of you, 
        all your accomplishments, and who you are. 
        <br>Congrats on completing one more cycle around the sun!
      </p>
      <p class="PS"> I have nothing else to say besides I love you, I always have, and I always will. </p>
