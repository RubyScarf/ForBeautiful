I am glad you are okay. 

I- am sorry. I actually put more effort into this than it shows. I ended up deleting most of the code. I couldn't get myself to finish it the way I wanted. I couldn't get myself to try just a bit more. 
I am sorry. I wanna hear about you, I wanna know how you were doing, I wanna know how you felt. Ultimately, I wanna make you feel better. But idk how. 
I'm sorry. There were numerous things I wanted to tell you, share with you. But I can't bring myself to mention one. 
Sorry. You shouldn't have to deal with this. 
  
Despite the fact i feel betrayed, i still value our friendship, i value you, i care about you. i hope you value me too. i feel like you wouldn't have written the message when you did if you didn't. 
  but also, idky it has to be over a month after not knowing anything about you, it was the most concerning, stressful, doubtful, lonely 5 weeks.
